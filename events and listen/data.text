When you click or raise any event, your event flow works in three phases (not two):

Phase 1: Capturing Phase
Event starts from the top-level element (window) and moves downward to the target element
This is the first phase that occurs
Phase 2: Target Phase
Event reaches the actual target element that was clicked/triggered
The event is handled on the target element itself
Phase 3: Bubbling Phase
Event starts from the target element and moves upward through the parent hierarchy
This is what your eventbubbling.js code demonstrates
Important Notes:
By default, event listeners work in the bubbling phase (Phase 3)
To capture events in the capturing phase (Phase 1), you need to set the third parameter to true:

//event capturing
hamesha phase 1 chaltab hai matlb parent se target pe jata per wo by default band rehta hai toh usse on karna rehta hai agar humne use on kiya tohhhhhhhhhhhhh hi phase 1 wala ans milega
//CAPTURE PHASE ON KARO
